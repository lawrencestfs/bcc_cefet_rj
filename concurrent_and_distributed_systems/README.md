# Concurrent and Distributed Systems

This repository is dedicated to the work I've developed in the Concurrent and Distributed Systems course from CEFET/RJ.

The project is a simple chat with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture, where the messages sent are broadcasted to all participants.

Usage:
- Start the server running the `chat_srv.py` script
- Star a new client running the `chat_cli.py` scritp. You can open multiple clients.
